## Day 1
### *Calories for Elves*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day1.py)
### Part One &#11088;
The elves start their journey to collect fruit, and bring their own rations. Who has the most calories 
on their person, i.e. who can the others ask to share snacks if needed?

### Part Two &#11088;
One elf with a lot of food is not reassuring enough, let's find the top three calorie-carriers.

## Day 2
### *Rock Paper Scissors for Snacks*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day2.py)
### Part One &#11088;
Who can have their tent closest to the snack storage is to be determined by a tournament of 
Rock Paper Scissors. To win (unsuspicously), follow your secret strategy guide and see what your 
score says.

### Part Two &#11088;
Actually the secret strategy guide was so secret you read it wrong. Try again with the new format!

## Day 3
### *Organisation for Rucksacks*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day3.py)
### Part One &#11088;
Packing contents of the elves' rucksacks is complicated, and both compartments per rucksack cannot
have any same items. Find the misplaced ones and prioritise their resorting!

### Part Two &#11088;
Also, the badges showing each elf's group of three are complicated and all wrong. Figure out which
item all three elves in a group have to relabel their badges. With priorities, of course!

## Day 4
### *Sections for Cleaning*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day4.py)
### Part One &#11088;
The elves' camp needs to be cleaned up to make room for new deliveries. The elves paired up to clean
but some have fully overlapping section, which is not the most efficient pairing. How many such pairings
are there?

### Part Two &#11088;
Actually, any overlap might be too inefficient. How many at all overlapping section pairings are there?

## Day 5
### *Crane for Crates*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day5.py)
### Part One &#11088;
The supply crates were unloaded from the ships, but need to be rearranged. You have a giant crane
at your disposal, that will move one crate at a time as instructed. Which crates will be on top of each stack?

### Part Two &#11088;
You realise that your giant crane can actually move multiple crates at once, so you use that to reorganise 
the crates. Which ones will now be on top at the end?

## Day 6
### *Buffer for Signals*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day6.py)
### Part One &#11088;
You are being bullied because of your skills and are handed a broken communication device.
You now need to figure out the buffer size before the packet start marker yourself.

### Part Two &#11088;
...as well as for the message start marker.

## Day 7
### *File Sizes for Updating*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day7.py)
### Part One &#11088;
Your device cannot update because it doesn't have enough disk space left. Use command line in- and outputs
to find each directories size. 

### Part Two &#11088;
Now that you know the folder sizes, find the smallest folder that you can delete to have enough
space for installing the update.

## Day 8
### *Trees for Houses*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day8.py)
### Part One &#11088;
You find a grid of nice trees, so naturally you wonder if you could build a tree house there.
Find out how protected from seeing eyes outside the tree grid the inner trees are.

### Part Two &#11088;
The elves would also like to know how scenic their potential tree house spot would be, meaning
how blocked their view in each direction would be. How far can you see around you?

## Day 9
### *Movement for Knots*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day9.py)
### Part One &#11088;
You see the swinging ropes of a rope bridge and wonder how the tail of the rope follows the head.
How much does the tail move?

### Part Two &#11088;
If the rope is much longer and you look at additional 8 knots moving with the rope between
its head and tail, how much does the tail move then?

## Day 10
### *Cycles for Pixels*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day10.py)
### Part One &#11088;
The screen on your communication device is broken! Now you need to learn to interpret the
device's signal yourself.

### Part Two &#11088;
You figured out how the signal is translated to pixels on the screen. Try your best to find
what the screen would have shown you!

## Day 11
### *Items for Monkeys*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day11.py)
### Part One &#11088;
Monkeys have stolen items from your backpack! They are inspecting them (which makes you nervous) and
then throwing them to another monkey. As you are too slow to get to all of them alone, focus on
the most monkey business going on, meaning the most active monkeys there.

### Part Two &#11088;
You begin to get increasingly worried, too worried in fact. Maybe you'll never get your things back. 
Maybe it will take 10 000 iterations of monkeys throwing things....you need to keep your worry in check!

## Day 12
### *Hiking for Signal*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day12.py)
### Part One &#11088;
Your current position is too low to get a signal from your fellow elves. Find a good way to hike up
to the highest point around while conserving your energy.

### Part Two &#11088;
You apparently enjoyed your hike, so you wonder which would be the best starting point for scenic route 
from lowest to highest point in this area, that the elves could make into a nice hiking trail.

## Day 13
### *Decoding for Distress*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day13.py)
### Part One &#11088;
You have received a distress signal, though the packets seem to be out of order. Which ones look correct?

### Part Two &#11088;
To decode the distress signal, you need to put the packets in the correct order, 
including the decoder key signifiers.

## Day 14
### *Cave Path for Sand*
[code &#8614;](https://github.com/VereLanz/my-advent-2022/blob/main/my_advent/day14.py)
### Part One &#11088;
You have found a cave behind a waterfall from where the distress signal seems to originate.
You notice some shaking, and then sand falling in the caves above you. How long will it take
until sand from above will start trickling into your part of the cave?

### Part Two &#11088;
Whoops, the scan actually showed *your* cave being filled with sand! Find out when the sand
stacks itself high enough to block the source and stops!
